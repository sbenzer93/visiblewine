1. What is this project?

This project was developed as a pilot project in the context of a master thesis at the University of Luxembourg, department Computer Science. The focus of the master thesis is to analyze the individual steps of an NFT project creation followed by an inventory of existing activities of ISO, CENELEC and JPEG standards activities.

On the one hand, the project refers to non-fungible token as a membership pass for the wine project. On the other hand, a software based on the blockchain technology Polygon is to be created.

The name visible wine arose from the recurring discussion about the quality of wine and the criticism about possible ingredients that do not have to be labeled as such. Visible Wine takes a different approach and discloses the complete value chain of wine production. In addition, as the owner of an NFT, it is possible to decide within the wine community how to grow grapes for the project.

2. Why does the project exist?

Blockchain business models are often said not to add value. Blockchain would create a solution for something for which there would be no problems. The author of the white paper contradicts this statement and tries to prove the opposite with the help of the exemplary project. 
What is definitely true from the author's point of view is the fact that most NFT projects do not generate cash flow outside the community, which is necessary for a sustainable and Ponzi-free business model. The project aims to demonstrate the benefits of a transparent and community-driven business model. On the one hand, there is the NFT project, which is aimed at NFT investors and is intended to be a closed system in itself. NFT holders benefit from various advantages, which will be described in the following.
On the other hand, a polygon-based platform is exchanged, which allows vintners and distributors to exchange information.
Through the so-called "Wine-as-a-Service", winegrowers can provide wine to business partners, which is cultivated and also distributed according to their ideas. The traceability is represented by the blockchain. 

3. How is the project implemented?

The individual building blocks for implementing the project are presented below.

Customer segments

• B2C - Wine customers, focus on lifestyle brand
• B2B - Wineries that use the “Wine-As-A-Service” system

Value propositions

• NFT holders have a vote through the DAO to vote on issues related to the project
• NFT holders participate in events, and receive wine for free
• Wine buyers receive a wine that is transparently grown according to guidelines set by the DAO community.

Channels

• Social Media activities, mainly via Twitter, Instagram, and Discord
• Presence in Metaverse such as Sandbox with its own virtual Winery

Customer relationships

• Wine buyers can be also owners of the project through the DAO model
• Building a user community
